ðŸ§  #LSPPDay11 of 60 Days Challenge by @lftechnology

Today I dove into the story of Object Detection â€” from 1970s to CNN, R-CNN to YOLO!
ðŸ“¦ Learned how YOLO:
ðŸ”¹ Grids the image
ðŸ”¹ Finds object center
ðŸ”¹ Calculates IOU
ðŸ”¹ Applies NMS for final clean boxes

ðŸš€ Ran my first YOLO model â€” it's magic!
